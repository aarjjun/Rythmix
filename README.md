### Project Description
Rhythmix is an interactive guessing game where users identify songs or movie scenes based on clues like lyrics, actors, or famous scenes. It blends media trivia with playful interaction, offering fans a fun way to test their pop culture knowledge.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Rhythmix solves the ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù problem of not knowing the title of a song or movie scene stuck in your head from just a vague line or actor's face. Instead of providing a genuinely helpful tool, it turns this into a playful guessing game, where users can throw in random clues and see if the system can figure it out‚Äîpurely for entertainment and laughs!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôre solving it by turning a simple idea into a guessing game playground! Users throw in any wild clue they have‚Äîbe it a mysterious lyric, a random actor's name, or a vague scene‚Äîand Rhythmix scrambles to match it to the right song or movie. It‚Äôs like asking your friend who ‚Äúkinda remembers everything but not really,‚Äù but way more entertaining. With every guess, Rhythmix gamifies the chaos of media memories for a fun, no-pressure experience!
